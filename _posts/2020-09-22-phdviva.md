  	Today on 22nd September 2020, I had my Ph.D. defence/viva-voce. I am happy that it went well and the panel members were happy with our work. Indeed felt that its a precious moment when I was addressed with the title "Dr."! I express my sincere gratitude to my guide Dr. Sowmya Kamath S who has literally guided me and supported me throughout this journey of earning my doctorate!
