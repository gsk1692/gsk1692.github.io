  	I am excited that Centre for Responsible AI (CeRAI) has launched at IIT Madas! The centre will be headed by Prof. Balaraman Ravindran! So happy that I was able to become a part of this by assisting Prof. Ravi in writing up the proposal for the centre. The centre will carry out fundamental and applied research in Responsible AI, AI safety and related avenues with an additional focus on the Indian landscape.

    Though I could not be part of the launch, being in the U.S., I am excited to work for the centre as Research Scientist at CeRAI, its first employee!
