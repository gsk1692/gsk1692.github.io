  	I am thrilled to join as Resaerch Scientist in the first of its kind centre in India, <a href="https://cerai.iitm.ac.in" target="_blank">"Centre for Responsible AI (CeRAI)"</a> at IIT Madras. I thank my mentor Prof. Balaraman Ravindran for the wonderful opportunity to not only learn more, but also for the opportunity to make an imapact in the Indian landscape of AI!
