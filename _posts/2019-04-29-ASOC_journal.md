  <p>29th April 2019! I will not forget this day. Today my first journal got published online (SCI indexed :P)!!! Thank God that a wonderful journal like Applied Soft Computing published my paper titled "<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494619302108" target="_blank"><i>A novel GA-ELM model for patient-specific mortality prediction over large-scale lab event data</i></a>". I know there is still a long way to go, but this is indeed a milestone in my life!</p>
  <p>There are so many people to thank. Most importantly, my guide (in research and life) and co-author: <a href="http://infotech.nitk.ac.in/faculty/sowmya-kamath-s" target="_blank">Dr. Sowmya Kamath S</a>, who continues to inspire me everyday! There are a bunch of people including my parents and my best friends who continuously supported me at times when I needed them the most. A huge thanks to them without whom this wouldn't have been possible!</p>
